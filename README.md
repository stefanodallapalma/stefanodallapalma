I am proactive, self-studier, with a strong can-do attitude person motivated by an inexhaustible enthusiasm and commitment and excited to follow-up collaborations with industries working in the Software Engineering domain.

Am intrigued and inclined towards areas of Artificial Intelligence applied to Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Recommendation Systems, with with a particular focus on software defect prediction, code smells detection, and software quality assurance in general.

🔭 I’m currently working on defect prediction of Infrastructure as Code, i.e., machine-readable, configuration code that is used to manage and provide services in cloud applications.
