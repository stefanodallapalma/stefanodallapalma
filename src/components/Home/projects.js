        title: "RADON (Horizon 2020)",
        task: "Quality assurance for decomposition, testing, and correctness of Infrastructure-as-Code",
        description: "In the context of my PhD, one of the main concerns regarded understanding the characteristics of defective Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts and defining models to detect them, as well as a tool suite for IaC defect prediction in practice. The Ph.D. was funded by the European Union’s Horizon research and innovation project called RADON (https://radon-h2020.eu). The project aims at pursuing a broader adoption of serverless computing technologies within the European software industry. One of RADON’s key pillars is quality assurance tools for Infrastructure as Code. As part of the RADON framework, the Defect Prediction tool (https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-defuse) developed during the PhD focuses on IaC correctness. It consists of several components to mine open-source repositories to identify failure data and to extract quality metrics to guide the empirical training and enrichment of the models for defect prediction as well as predict code smells and errors in IaC files. Although instantiated in the context of infrastructure as code, the defect predictor was envisioned and designed to be language-agnostic.",
